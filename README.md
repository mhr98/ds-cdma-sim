# Simulating the BER of DS-CDMA system under different channel types
This project simulates the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of a Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) system under different channel types.  
It first defines an m-sequence spreading code that was generated using LFSR, then evaluates the statistical characteristics of the codes.  
It also simulates the BER of the system under various channel conditions:
- AWGN  
- AWGN and Multipath fading with conventional receiver  
- AWGN with Multipath fading and Rake receiver  

It shows the advantage of using CDMA in mitigating the effects of the multipath channel, and multiplexing many users at the same time.
